## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Intermediate upgrade progress event `UpgradedControlPlane` when control plane upgrade completes during cluster upgrades.
- Event deduplication using `giantswarm.io/emitted-upgrade-events` annotation to prevent repeated notifications.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-07-18

### Added

- Enhanced MachinePool version checking by connecting to workload clusters to inspect individual node versions.
- Direct node version validation for MachinePools using `giantswarm.io/machine-pool` labels and workload cluster connectivity.
- Improved MachineDeployment version checking with individual Machine resource validation through ownership chain traversal.
- Graceful fallback to basic status checking when workload cluster access fails.
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) support for automatic resource scaling based on cluster count and workload (enabled by default).
- Memory usage optimizations for handling multiple clusters simultaneously.

### Fixed

- Corrected version matching logic for pinned MachinePools and MachineDeployments that have explicit `spec.template.spec.version` set to allow control plane upgrades while keeping worker nodes at specific versions.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-07-18

### Fixed

- Fixed MachinePools rollout completion check to verify replica counts match exactly and all referenced nodes are running the expected Kubernetes version.
- Improved upgrade completion logic to ignore nodes in SchedulingDisabled state that are being drained and terminated.
- Added support for staged upgrades where MachinePools may be intentionally pinned to older versions than the cluster target version.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-07-15

### Fixed

- Ensured cluster upgrade completion is only reported when all worker nodes are fully updated and ready.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-07-08

### Fixed

- RBAC permissions for `MachinePools` and `MachineDeployments`.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-07-03

### Added

- Support for both `MachineDeployments` and `MachinePools` worker node tracking.
- Added logging for upgrade progress monitoring.

### Fixed

- Annotation update conflicts causing "object has been modified" errors.
- Premature "Upgraded" events when only control plane was ready - now waits for all worker nodes.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-24

### Changed 

- Disable logger development mode to avoid panicking, use zap as logger.
- Go: Update dependencies.
- Fix linting issues.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-08-21

### Added 

- Set new annotations `giantswarm.io/cluster-upgrading` on Cluster CR.

### Fixed

- Ignore updating ready condition timestamps like `ClusterReconcilerNormalFailed` which would send Upgrade events.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-08-16

### Added

- Set new annotations `giantswarm.io/last-known-cluster-upgrade-timestamp` and `giantswarm.io/last-known-cluster-upgrade-version` on Cluster CR.

## [0.1.6] - 2024-08-14

### Fixed

- Events RBAC.

## [0.1.5] - 2024-08-13

### Fixed

- Transition timestamp.

## [0.1.4] - 2024-08-13

### Fixed

- PSP RBAC.

## [0.1.3] - 2024-08-13

### Fixed

- Added `events.k8s.io` as apiGroup in RBAC.

## [0.1.2] - 2024-08-13

## [0.1.1] - 2024-08-13

## [0.1.0] - 2024-08-13
